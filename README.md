# Weather Prediction Classification Algorithm

This project implements a classification algorithm that leverages weather prediction data to classify or predict specific outcomes, such as:
- Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, stormy).
- Suitability for outdoor activities.
- Alerts for severe weather conditions.

## Introduction

Weather predictions are essential for planning activities, mitigating risks, and improving safety. This classification algorithm uses weather prediction data (such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure) to provide actionable insights and classifications.

### Goals:
- Improve decision-making using predictive analytics.
- Provide a flexible framework for integrating weather data.
- Achieve high accuracy with minimal computational overhead.

## Features

- **Data Input:** Accepts historical and real-time weather data.
- **Customizable Models:** Supports multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks).
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Visualization:** Includes tools for data visualization and result interpretation.
- **Weather Alerts:** Implements thresholds for alerting severe conditions.

## Algorithm Overview

The classification algorithm uses the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Normalize numerical features.
   - Encode categorical variables.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identify the most relevant weather parameters for classification.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Support for multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

4. **Prediction and Evaluation:**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

## Dataset

This system requires a dataset with weather-related features. Example features:
- `temperature`: Average daily temperature (Â°C).
- `humidity`: Relative humidity (%).
- `wind_speed`: Wind speed (km/h).
- `pressure`: Atmospheric pressure (hPa).
- `condition`: Label (e.g., Sunny, Rainy, Stormy).

You can use publicly available datasets, such as:
- [NOAA Weather Data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Results

The classification algorithm achieves:
- **Accuracy:** ~90% on test datasets.
- **Precision/Recall:** Depends on the dataset and class distribution.

Example output:
- Predicted conditions for a week ahead.
- Alerts for high-risk weather patterns.
